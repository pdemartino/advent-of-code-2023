# Advent of Code 2023

Oh Gosh, writing READMEs for Git projects!!!

Ok, long story short:
- I don't like JS and Kotlin, but I need to use them for work and I want to know them well
- I like Java but cool kidz say it's verbose and we need to work with Kotlin, but I still like it and I don't want to fall behind with it
- I use Bash scripting everyday for automation, I like it and I want to improve
- Rust... I don't know any Rust and I don't even know whether I like it, but everyone is talking about it like if it was the holy graal, hence I think it's worth giving it a try

How do I study all of those languages make some exercise?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) is a funny initiative and I'll implement some of the problems with all of those languages. That will let me also compare them and maybe find the new language of my ❤️.
